This is an operating systems course at Stanford, and it was one of the most enjoyable courses I've ever taken, thanks to the dedication of the Stanford faculty and teaching assistants.

The experiments were done by myself, and there were few useful answers online (and I did try), so I was able to enjoy the course on my own, starting with the uart serial protocol, moving on to "hello world" and hardware and software interrupts, and then moving on to the familiar things about operating systems, such as processes, processes, etc. Memory and file system, etc.

What I regret is that I can't communicate with other students. So I stayed for a long time on a lot of technical issues, I had to go online and read a lot of material, so it took me a lot of unnecessary time to complete the course.
