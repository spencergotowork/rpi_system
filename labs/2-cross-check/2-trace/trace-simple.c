// part 1: trace GET32/PUT32 (also: get32, put32).
//
// extension: add a simple log for capturing
//
//  without capture it's unsafe to call during UART operations since infinitely
//  recursive and, also, will mess with the UART state.  
//
//  record the calls in a log (just declare a statically sized array until we get malloc)
//  for later emit by trace_dump()
//
// extension: keep adding more functions!  
//      often it's useful to trace at a higher level, for example, doing 
//      uart_get() vs all the put's/get's it does, since that is easier for
//      a person to descipher.  or, you can do both:
//          -  put a UART_PUTC_START in the log.
//          - record the put/gets as normal.
//          - put a UART_PUTC_STOP in the log.
